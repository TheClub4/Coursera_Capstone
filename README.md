# Strategic Clustering for Establishing a Restaurant

**Objective**: Realizing the optimal location to open an Asian restaurant in Toronto, Canada using k-Means Clustering.

The objective of this capstone project is to locate the optimal neighborhood for operation. Our foundation of reasoning would be based on spending power, distribution of ethnic group, and competition, across each neighbourhood. We will mainly be utilizing the Foursquare API and the extensive geographical and census data from Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal.

The purpose for this Jupyter Notebook was intended for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project.
